// Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.69 (pinout from https://docs.waveshare.com/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.69).
// Selected automatically when the sketch is compiled for the esp32s3 target.
//
// Two hardware revisions exist. The GPIOs below are the current one (buzzer 42, PWR on 40/41,
// RTC INT 39). The first batch wired the buzzer to 33, SYS_EN to 35, SYS_OUT to 36 and RTC INT to
// 41; define BOARD_S3_TOUCH169_V1 to build for it.
